In this Application i am using 
-> RoomData base 
-> Async Task 
-> Activity
-> Fragment
-> Services
-> Spinner
-> Recycler view
-> Card View
-> MVVM

-------------------------------

it is basically used to store the book details (name , price) based on different category , spinner is used here to switch between the 
category type , room data base is used for storing purpose 
for delete any record use left swipe 
on click of any book you be able to see the details of book and u also able to update the books details .
FAB button is used to add the new record 
MVVM architecture here i am using , so on change of orientation the activity or fragment not getting recreated
